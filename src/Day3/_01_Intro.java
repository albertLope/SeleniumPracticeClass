        1) Get the libraries in the project

        2) What kind of locators selenium has all list Show PPT
            ID
            Class
            linktext
            partialLinktext
            tags
            CSS
            Xpath


        4) First example for the class http://www.practiceselenium.com/  Look --> a2 ID Start class

               Students learned testNG so instead of using System.out.println we can use Assert.assertEquals or assertTrue

        5) Second example website for the elements http://demo.guru99.com/test/login.html a3IDPractice
              We will give some example about the ID this time and we can use the assert as well.

        6) Third example for the website http://demo.guru99.com/test/accessing-link.html to practice a4LinkTextPartialLinkText
                NOTE : MENTION --> Linktext or PartialLinkText need to have "a" tag with out "a" tag these will not work

        7) Forth example this website http://demoqa.com/links  --> click on created and verify created is displayed in the text.

        NOTE : We can use findElements to show the how to use tags but we should also mention the we will learn the findElements
